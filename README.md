The general features (if not already listed in the description) are left/right click support, which you can toggle under the min/max CPS sliders, fully adjustable CPS via said sliders, a randomized CPS mode for games like minecraft, customizable toggle hotkeys, a dark mode, and a low latency mode which replaces time.sleep() with a CPU-busy loop for maximum precision, and a dark mode. You can start the autoclicker by pressing the clicking toggle under the apply settings button, or by pressing your set hotkey. If the autoclicker's CPS isn't changed after you've set it, please click the apply settings button below all modes.
